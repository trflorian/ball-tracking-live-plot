# Ball Tracking with Live Trajectory Visualization

In this project I showcase how you can create an animated plot with OpenCV and Matplotlib. To demonstrate the real-time animated plotting, I am tracking a ball that is thrown vertically into the air. The ball's vertical position, velocity and acceleration are plotted in the figure. Polynomial functions are used to fit a model to the motion of the ball and predict its trajectory.

## ðŸŒŸ Quickstart

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for setup. Simply run the `tracker.py` script with uv to install the project dependencies and get started!

```Shell
uv run src/tracker.py
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Matplotlib + OpenCV

To get a plot/figure from matplotlib into OpenCV, I render the canvas into a buffer in memory, store the buffer in a numpy array and transform it to the correct BGR format to display in OpenCV.

```Python
fig.canvas.draw()

buf = fig.canvas.buffer_rgba()
plot = np.asarray(buf)
plot = cv2.cvtColor(plot, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Blitting
The naive draw call in matplotlib as shown above is quite expensive, the full figure needs to be re-drawn every frame. To improve the performance, I make use of a technique called [blitting](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/blitting.html). 
This allows me to only re-draw regions that have changed and therefore drastically redducing the rendering time.

```Python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(10, 2), dpi=100)

...

# initialize empty plots
pl_pos = axs[0].plot([], [], c="b")[0]
pl_vel = axs[1].plot([], [], c="b")[0]
pl_acc = axs[2].plot([], [], c="b")[0]

# draw initial backgrounds
fig.canvas.draw()
bg_axs = [fig.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox) for ax in axs]

while True:
  ...

  # Update plots
  pl_pos.set_data(range(len(pos)), pos)
  pl_vel.set_data(range(len(vel)), vel)
  pl_acc.set_data(range(len(acc)), acc)
  
  # Blit Pos
  fig.canvas.restore_region(bg_axs[0])
  axs[0].draw_artist(pl_pos)
  fig.canvas.blit(axs[0].bbox)
  
  # Blit Vel
  fig.canvas.restore_region(bg_axs[1])
  axs[1].draw_artist(pl_vel)
  fig.canvas.blit(axs[1].bbox)
  
  # Blit Acc
  fig.canvas.restore_region(bg_axs[2])
  axs[2].draw_artist(pl_acc)
  fig.canvas.blit(axs[2].bbox)

  # show plot, cv2.waitKey etc.
  ...
```

## ðŸ”® Trajectory Prediction
Based on a simple physics model with constant acceleration equal to the gravitational acceleration, the ball's position, velocity and acceleration plots are polynomial functions of degree 2, 1 and 0.
To calculate the polynomial factors, the polyfit numpy function is used. Then the polynomials are evaluated for each step in the timeframe and plotted on top of the tracked state of the ball.

```Python
poly_pos = np.polyfit(t_pos, pos, deg=2)
poly_vel = np.polyfit(t_vel, vel, deg=1)
poly_acc = np.polyfit(t_acc, acc, deg=0)

t_pred = np.arange(num_frames + 5)

polyval_pos = np.polyval(poly_pos, t_pred)
polyval_vel = np.polyval(poly_vel, t_pred)
polyval_acc = np.polyval(poly_acc, t_pred)
```

## ðŸŽ¥ Streaming Trajectory

Check `src/stream.py` on how to use `deque` from `collections` to create a fixed-length buffer of trajectory points.
